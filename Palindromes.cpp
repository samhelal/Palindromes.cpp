/*17. 4.27 (Palindromes) A palindrome is a number or a text phrase
that reads the same backward as forward. For example, each
of the following five-digit integers is a palindrome: 12321,
55555, 45554 and 11611. Write a program that reads in a five-
digit integer and determines whether itâ€™s a palindrome. [Hint:
Use the division and remainder operators to separate the
number into its individual digits.]*/
